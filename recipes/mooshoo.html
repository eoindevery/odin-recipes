    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold water, divided</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons sesame oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken breast tenderloins, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded cabbage or coleslaw mix</li>
        <li>1 (4-ounce) can sliced shiitake mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sherry</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of water, 2 teaspoons of sesame oil, and cornstarch until
            dissolved. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Set aside to marinate.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the 4 remaining tablespoons of water, the remaining 1 teaspoon of sesame
            oil, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce until well-combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour the beaten eggs and cook for 3
            minutes. Flip it over and cook for 3 minutes more, or until set. Slice scrambled eggs into thin strips.</li>
        <li>To the same skillet over medium-high heat, add the chicken strips. Cook for 6 minutes on one side and flip.
            Cook for 6 more minutes, or until golden brown and juices run clear. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the remaining teaspoon of vegetable oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shredded
            cabbage, drained shiitake mushrooms, garlic, and sherry. Cook, stirring regularly until the cabbage starts
            to wilt, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken, eggs, and sauce mixture. Stir until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
            Mix in the green onions and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Save yourself some time and just get a bag of coleslaw mix instead of chopping or shredding cabbage. Try to get a
        multi-colored slaw mix for a more appetizing dish.</p>
    <p>Button mushrooms and cremini mushrooms will work, too. You could even use portobello and leave out the chicken
        for a vegetarian dish.</p>
    <p>This article doesn’t include a recipe for Mandarin pancakes because there’s no need to make them from scratch!
        These paper-thin crepes are available at Asian grocery stores. And even if you can’t find them, you can always
        count on flour tortillas.</p>
