    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Chicken Divan recipe makes a glorious casserole filled with juicy bite-sized chicken, crunchy broccoli
        florets, a ridiculously creamy sauce, and a crumbly and buttery topping, to boot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh broccoli, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cooked chicken meat, sliced into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 (10.75-ounce) can condensed cream of broccoli soup</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Place the broccoli in a saucepan and fill it with water. Bring the water to a boil. Cook the broccoli for 5
            minutes, or until tender. Drain.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked broccoli to a 9-inch pie plate. Top with sliced chicken.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the condensed soup and milk. Pour the mixture over the chicken. Sprinkle with
            cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine melted butter and bread crumbs until it looks like wet sand. Sprinkle the
            mixture over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For a hearty meal, you can’t go wrong with Chicken Divan and rice or pasta!</p>
    <p>But if you’re looking for a healthier option, you can also go for quinoa and cauliflower rice.</p>
    <p>For a lighter option, pair chicken divan with roasted veggies or fresh fruit salad.</p>
