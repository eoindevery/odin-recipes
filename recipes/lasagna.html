        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Barilla lasagna recipe is full of layers of delicious ground meat, marinara sauce, and ooey-gooey cheese.
        It’s the definition of decadence!</p>
    <p>Having three different components, lasagna is not the easiest thing to make. But it only takes one whiff of this
        Italian masterpiece to know that it’s worth it. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles (Preferably Barilla but any favorite brand will do)</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce (Barilla lor another high-quality sauce)</li>
        <li>Bulk Italian sausage or ground beef(already cooked and drained)</li>
        <li>Ricotta, Mozzarella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano (Trio of cheeses)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove lasagna noodles from heat after 4 minutes, They will continue to cook as they bake.</li>
        <li>To stop the noodles from further cooking, transfer them into a colander and run them under cold water</li>
        <li>Stop the noodles from sticking together by laying them in a single layer on a sheet of parchment paper
            brushed with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Here's an alternative "cooking" method: soak the noodles in hot water for 30 minutes.l They'll be soft
            enough by then.</li>
        <li>Shred your own Mozzarella for maximum melting potential</li>
        <li>Use freshly grated parmesan cheese for optimum flavor. Real parmesan only; not canned.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with marinara sauce before adding the lasagna noodles. Otherwise, the noodles will
            stick to the pan, and it will be tough to take them out when slicing. Be sure the bottom of the pan is well
            coated!</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before you slice and serve. If you slice it straight from the oven, the
            layers will fall apart as you cut. Give it time to set!
        </li>
        <li>Use a chefs knife to slice the lasagna into squares. Use a flexible spatula to transfer it from the pan to
            the plate.</li>
        <li>To reheat leftover lasagna, cover the pan with foil and bake at 360 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 30
            minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>To freeze leftover lasagna, wrap the pan in plastic wrap twice and once in foil. Transfer it to the fridge a
            day before use. Reheat at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. Frozen lasagna lasts for up to 2-3 months.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Ideally you would use a regular 9x13 baking dish, which gives you space for all those layers. Limit the layers to
        three, which is exactly what the recipe calls for. It’s not as hearty as the classic lasagna, but the flavors
        will still be there.</p>
